# BA-Subway-Demand-Climate-Impact-2019Q4

# Master's Thesis in Data Science

## Repository Description
This repository houses the Master's Thesis in Data Science, focusing on the development of a suite of statistical time series, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning algorithms aimed at predicting the demand for subway tickets in Buenos Aires and the impact of rainfall for the last quarter of 2019. An evaluation of the prediction capabilities of these algorithms is conducted. Each algorithm attempts to forecast medium-term future demand for the service.

## Algorithms Evaluated
The performance of these algorithms is assessed using the following metrics:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **SMAPE** (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## Descriptive Analysis
Included is a descriptive analysis of rainfall behavior in both residential and central areas across all subway lines, which is crucial for understanding the environmental impacts on subway usage.

## Turnstile Usage Analysis
This section provides an analysis of turnstile usage by different demand groups, highlighting the variability and patterns of subway service utilization.

## Conclusion
The insights derived from these analyses aim to enhance the predictability and efficiency of public transportation systems, contributing to better urban planning and resource allocation.
